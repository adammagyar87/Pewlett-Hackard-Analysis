## Overview of the analysis:
Facing a wave of pending retirements, management wanted a list of the positions that will likely need to be taken over by other employees or new hires. A few managers requested lists specific to their departments. A mentorship program was also discussed and a list of candidates was requested for this program. The data was in excel files, and it was decided that a SQL database would be the best tool to manage the employee data and generate the lists we need. 

## Results:
- We first decided to compile a list of current employees born from 1952 to 1955 which are the most likely to retire in the short term. Our initial list of employees had repeat data that included previous job titles held by these employees. We then filtered the data to only include each employees most recent role. These results are stored in the "unique_titles.csv" file. 


There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)
Summary:

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
